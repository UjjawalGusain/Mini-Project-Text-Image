# PiXplorer: A Text-to-Image Retrieval System

## Introduction
PiXplorer in an advance Text to Image Retrieval System designed to simplify the image seaching process from large databases through text descriptions. 

PiXplorer leverages the power of deep learning and vector databases to provide fast, accurate, and intuitive image retrieval. By mapping images and text into a common vector space, PiXplorer ensures that your search descriptions are seamlessly matched with the most relevant images, making it an ideal tool for both personal and professional use.

With PiXplorer, explore your images with ease and precision!
